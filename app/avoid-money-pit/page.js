        </h1>

        <p className="mb-5">
          Many people think that serious defects in a home are easy to spot, but
          the truth is, often the most serious and costly problems can only be
          detected upon very close inspection. When you are considering buying a
          home, look for the following six telltale signs of serious problems...

              1. Roof
            </h2>
            <p>
              Leaks are the most common problem with roofs, and are tough to
              detect from outside. However, from inside an attic, you can often
              see water marks where there is a leak.

            <p>
              Make sure you are confident that both water systems: the one that
              brings fresh water in and the one that takes sewage out are
              functioning well before signing on the dotted line.

            </h2>
            <p>
              Before you agree to buy you should make sure that you can run all
              of the appliances you want to and even power tools at the same
              time without having a power failure. You also want to make sure
              that the electrical system is safe and does not present a fire
              hazard.

            </h2>

              Be sure to thoroughly inspect the heating and air conditioning
              systems in any home you are considering purchasing.

              5. Bad Paint and Signs of Rotting
            </h2>
            <p>
              The paint inside and outside the house can reveal a lot about the
              condition of the underlying material. Check several places on
              several walls, using your eyes and a screwdriver for poking.

              6. Cracks and other important signs
            </h2>
            <p>
              Cracks in walls, doors not closing properly and uneven floors can
              all be signs that there is a problem with the foundation. If the
              foundation is not strong, the entire house could literally
              collapse, so you should carefully check for these signs. A bad
              foundation may not mean imminent disaster, but it could be used to
              bargain for a lower sale price, or you could ask to have the owner
              repair it before the sale.
