          How Your Credit Score Affects You
        </h1>

        <div className="space-y-3">
          <p>
            Your credit score is critical to your financial health; as it
            reflects your creditworthiness. Essentially, your credit score
            determines how much money you can borrow, what interest rate and how
            much is feasible for you to pay. Your credit score is based on your
            credit report, which includes information about your credit history
            - your payment history, how much debt you owe, how long you&apos;ve
            had credit, the types of credit you have, and how often you apply
            for credit.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Canada and the U.S., most lenders use the FICO credit score
            system, which ranges from 300 to 900. The higher your credit score,
            the more likely you will be approved for a mortgage and the better
            the terms that are available to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, if you have a credit score of 750 or higher, you can
            get a mortgage with a low interest rate and a small down payment. A
            lower interest rate means lower monthly payments, which can save you
            thousands of dollars over the life of your mortgage.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, if your credit score is below 600, you may have
            difficulty getting approved for a mortgage and may be required to
            make a larger down payment or pay a higher interest rate. A higher
            interest rate means higher monthly payments, which can make it
            harder to afford your mortgage payment and other expenses.

          Significant Factors Impacting Your Credit Score
        </h2>

        <div className="space-y-3">
          <p>
            Here are the most important factors affecting your credit score:
          </p>
          <p>
            #1 Defaulting on a Loan Defaulting on a loan has the most severe
            negative impact on your credit score. It means you have failed to
            repay the loan as agreed, and it can stay on your credit report for
            up to seven years. A default can significantly reduce your credit
            score and make it challenging to get approved for credit in the
            future.
          </p>
          <p>
            #2 Late Payments
            <br />
            Payment history is the most significant factor determining your
            credit score. Late and missed payments significantly reduce your
            credit score. The longer you delay your payments, the more it
            negatively affects your score. Even one late payment can have a
            considerable impact on your credit score.
          </p>
          <p>
            #3 Credit Utilization
            <br />
            Credit utilization is the ratio of outstanding credit card balances
            to credit limits. A high credit utilization ratio indicates that you
            are using a significant amount of your available credit, which may
            suggest that you are overextended and need help to make payments.
            Keeping your credit utilization ratio below 30% is ideal for
            maintaining a good credit score.
          </p>
          <p>
            #4 Credit Applications
            <br />
            When you apply for credit, the lender performs a hard inquiry on
            your credit report. Too many hard inquiries in a short period can
            lower your credit score as it suggests you are actively seeking
            credit and may be at a higher risk of defaulting on your payments.
          </p>
          <p>
            #5 Credit Accounts
            <br />
            Closing credit accounts can negatively impact your credit score,
            especially if you have a long credit history. Creditors prefer to
            see that you have a lengthy credit history and can manage multiple
            credit accounts effectively. Closing an account will reduce the
            average age of your credit accounts, which can lower your credit
            score.

          Maintaining a Healthy Credit Score
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-2">
          Here are some tips to keep your credit score healthy:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
          <li>Pay your bills on time every month.</li>
          <li>
            Keep your credit card balances below 30% of your credit limit.
          </li>
          <li>
            Don&apos;t apply for too much credit. Only apply for credit when you
            need it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Apply for credit products with lower interest rates; you will likely
            be approved for (e.g. personal loans).
          </li>
          <li>
            Check your credit report regularly. Errors on your credit report can
            hurt your score, so review your report regularly and dispute any
            errors you find.
          </li>
          <li>
            Build your credit history. The longer you have had credit, the
            better it looks to lenders. If you are new to credit, consider
            getting a secured credit card. With a secured card, you&apos;ll need
            to make a deposit upfront, which is collateral for your credit
            limit. Making regular payments on a secured card can help build your
            credit history and improve your score.
          </li>
        </ul>

          Building Up Your Credit Score
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-2">
          Improving your credit score takes time and effort, but because it
          results in getting the best terms on your mortgage, it is worth it.
          Here&apos;s how you can improve your credit score:
        </p>
        <div className="space-y-2 pb-8">
          <p>
            #1 Get a copy of your credit report
            <br />
            The first step to rebuilding your credit score is to get a copy of
            your credit report. You can request a free copy of your credit
            report from Equifax or TransUnion in Canada. Review your credit
            report carefully to identify any errors or inaccuracies that may
            negatively impact your score. If you find any errors, dispute them
            with the credit bureau.
          </p>
          <p>
            #2 Pay down your debts
            <br />
            While having debt can be okay if managed carefully, paying it off on
            time helps you build your credit score. The amount of debt you have
            limits the amount you can borrow. If you have significant debt and
            interest rates rise, each month your payments can become too much.
            If you are using a significant amount of your available credit, this
            may suggest you are overextended and may struggle to make payments.
            The less debt you have, the better your credit utilization ratio
            will be, which can help improve your credit score.
          </p>
          <p>
            #3 Start budgeting to pay your bills on time
            <br />
            Start paying your bills on time with no exceptions. Make this the #1
            priority each month. Creating a monthly budget helps you take
            control of your financial health. You can use a budgeting app or a
            Google or Excel sheet to plan your expenses.
          </p>
          <p>
            #4 Seek professional help
            <br />
            If you are struggling to rebuild your credit score, consider seeking
            professional help from a credit counsellor or financial advisor.
            They can help you develop a plan to improve your score, manage your
            debts, and create a budget.
