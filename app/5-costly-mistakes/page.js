          5 Costly Mistakes Home Buyers Keep Repeating
        </h1>

        <p className="mb-3">
          Purchasing a property is probably the most significant investment
          you&apos;re about to make. And it&apos;s quite normal that your emotions come
          into play with such a huge and personal purchase. Especially for
          first-time buyers, buying a new place can seem overly complicated and
          even confusing.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-3">
          Instead of only focusing on finding your dream home or being a home
          improvement expert, you should be as rational as you can with your
          decision, no matter how personal this purchase is. Knowing what
          problems to expect, you can avoid expensive errors and feel more
          confident while shopping.

          don&apos;t have to):

              #1 Skipping Mortgage Pre-Approval
            </h2>
            <p>
              Pre-approval is necessary before placing an offer on a home or
              even before you go house-hunting. It doesn&apos;t only give you an
              overview of what budget to plan for. Most sellers won&apos;t accept
              offers nowadays without a pre-approval letter. Be aware that even
              if you have been pre-approved for a mortgage, your loan can fall
              through at the last minute if you do something to alter your
              credit score, such as finance a car purchase.

              #2 Not Getting a Home Inspection
            </h2>
            <p>
              A home inspection is an essential part of the home-buying process.
              It can uncover hidden problems or defects that may not be apparent
              during a walkthrough. Skipping a home inspection to save money or
              speed up the buying process can cost you much more in the long
              run. A professional inspector can identify issues with the
              property&apos;s structure, plumbing, electrical, and HVAC systems that
              could lead to costly repairs or replacements.

              #3 A Fixer-Upper Is Not Always a Good Idea
            </h2>
            <p>
              Yes, a fixer-upper sounds like a good idea until you actually have
              to start fixing it. If you are on a strict budget, look for homes
              the potential of which has yet to be realized. The upgrades you
              make will increase the value of your home and thus give you a
              bigger budget for your next purchase. However, be careful not to
              overestimate the type and amount of work you can do by yourself.
              Also, consult your real estate agent to learn what upgrade will
              add the most value to your home.

              #4 Overbidding for Fear of Losing Out
            </h2>
            <p>
              Jumping in too fast or waiting too long to put in an offer are
              both risky in terms of cost and what kind of property you might
              end up with. To make sure you are not overbidding or repeatedly
              writing offers with no success, hire an experienced real estate
              agent. An experienced agent knows how much above or below the
              asking price properties in an area are sold and can help you
              devise an effective offer strategy.

              #5 Not Shopping Around Enough
            </h2>
            <p>
              Many buyers think they&apos;re best off taking a mortgage with the
              lender they currently bank at. But this may not be the case. You
              can use a mortgage broker to learn about the different options you
              have at your disposal. Always make sure to have a breakdown of the
              total costs of each mortgage option on the table, including
              penalties for breaking the mortgage early.
