          How to Save Thousands of Dollars in Interest and Pay Your Mortgage off
          Faster
        </h1>

        <p className="mb-6">
          There are a few easy ways to make extra principle payments that can
          save you a ton of money in interest expenses and get you
          mortgage-free sooner than you thought possible. Here are a few simple
          strategies you can use:

        <h2 className="text-[34px] leading-[1.1] font-medium text-slate-700 mb-2">
          1. Round your monthly payment up
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-3">
          The results of this simple strategy can save you a fortune and
          drastically reduce the length of your mortgage.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-7">
          As an example, if your monthly mortgage payments were $734 dollars a
          month, but you rounded it up to $800 per month, you would save more
          than $48,000 in interest payments, and reduce the length of your
          mortgage by 7.5 years!
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-[34px] leading-[1.1] font-medium text-slate-700 mb-2">
          2. Make One Time Pre-Payments Using Your Income Tax Refund
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-7">
          This is an easy way to save money and shorten your mortgage. For
          example, if you have a $100,000 mortgage, and you have a $1000 tax
          refund this year, you take apply that refund to your mortgage. Over
          time, this will save you more than $8600 and shave 1 year and 1 month
          off your mortgage! That&apos;s another amazing result from a simple
          strategy.

          3. Choose a 15 Year Mortgage
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-3">
          If you can afford it, you are far better off getting a 15 year
          mortgage instead of 30. It won&apos;t cost you much more, and the
          interest savings are truly incredible.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-3">
          If you have a mortgage of $100,000 at 8% interest over 15 years, your
          monthly payment would be about $200 more, but you&apos;d end up saving
          $92,083 in interest over the life of your mortgage!
        </p>
        <p className="pb-8">
          Using these strategies is the easiest way to reduce your interest
          expenses and shorten your mortgage period.
